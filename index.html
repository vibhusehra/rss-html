	<p>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical shooter video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It was released worldwide on <u>December 2015</u> for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game puts heavy emphasis on environmental destruction and cooperation between players. Players assume control of an attacker or a defender in different gameplay modes such as hostage rescuing and bomb defusing. The title has no campaign, but features a series of short missions that can be played solo. These missions have a loose narrative, focusing on recruits going through training to prepare them for future encounters with the White Masks, a terrorist group that threatens the safety of the world.

			<h2>MODES</h2>
			<p>At launch, the game featured 11 maps and 5 different gameplay modes. With the downloadable content (DLC) – an additional four maps from season one and the two maps from season two – there are currently 17 maps </p>

			<ul>
				
				<li><span class="head">HOSTAGE:</span>:a competitive multiplayer mode, in which the attackers must extract the hostage from the defenders, while the defenders must prevent the hostage from being rescued. A secondary manner of winning can occur if the attacking or defending team accidentally damages the hostage, causing the hostage to "down"; if the opposing team can prevent revival of the hostage, and the hostage bleeds-out and dies, they will win the round.</li>

				<li><span class="head">BOMB:</span>a competitive multiplayer mode, in which the attackers are tasked with locating and defusing one of two bombs. The defenders must stop the attackers by killing all of them or destroying the defuser.If all attackers are killed after the defuser is planted, the defuser must still be destroyed for a defending victory.</li>

				<li><span class="head">SECURE AREA:</span>a competitive multiplayer mode, in which the defenders must protect a room with biohazard containers, while the attackers must fight their way in. The match ends when all players from one team are killed or the biohazard container is secured by the attackers when there are no defenders in the room.</li>

				<li><span class="head">TERRORIST HUNT:</span> a solo or cooperative multiplayer mode for up to five players. Players take on the role of either attackers or defenders, and must fight against waves of enemies controlled by artificial intelligence.</li>

				<li><span class="head">SITUATIONS:</span>the game's most significant single-player component, with 11 scenarios that serve as introductions and tutorials to the game's mechanics.</li>

				<li><span class="head">TACTICAL REALISM: </span> a variation of the standard competitive multiplayer modes, added with the release of the Operation Skull Rain DLC. The game mode features a heavier emphasis on realism and teamwork, removing most of the heads-up display (HUD) elements, the ability to mark opponents, and the ability to see teammates' contours through walls, while also featuring the addition of a realistic ammo management system</li>
